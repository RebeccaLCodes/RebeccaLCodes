- 👋 Hi, I’m @RebeccaLCodes
- 👀 I’m interested in God, family, and travel. My Ohana and I enjoy volunteering in the community, studying and traveling abroad, and finding new adventures in life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can for software engineering and Spanish- want to learn it before we travel to Costa Rica and Brazil.
- We learned our lesson on not speaking Italian (other than greetings) when we lived in Italy.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fun engaging sites and apps that include education, lifestyle, culture, travel, and ecotourism.
- 📫 How to reach me by email- RebeccaLCodes@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: I use them. 
- ⚡ Fun facts: I was honored to wear Sansa's cloak during our adventure through Northern Ireland on the Games of Thrones tour. I have hiked in the Rocky Mountains, Blue Ridge Mountains,
- Sierra Nevadas, Wichita Mountains, and the Apennines, played in Central Park, explored the Tolleymore Forest near Belfast, ate in Fisherman's Wharf, and attended a ton of rodeos, yet I've never
- been to the legendary Bluegrass Festival in my hometown of Guthrie, OK because I always say it costs too much.
